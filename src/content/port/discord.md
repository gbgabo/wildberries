## Info

1. It works on Betterdiscord, Vencord and Vesktop, it should also work on other Discord clients.
2. Special thanks to MrTipson on GitHub for the base.css https://github.com/MrTipson/DiscordCSS

## Installation

1. Download the .css file from this page
2. Extract it
3. Place it inside /path/to/BetterDiscord/themes
4. Activate it by going to the Discord Settings menu and on BetterDiscord -> Themes, you should see the theme click the enable button

## Troubleshoot

1. If it doesn't get detected make sure that the name is wildberries(or any other name).theme.css, .THEME.CSS otherwise it won't be detected by BetterDiscord
2. Sometimes when the theme breaks due to Discord's new UI updates, go to the theme in your prefered text editor, and save it again to update it, or turn-off and turn-on again the theme, this might not work if MrTipson doesn't update the base.css that I use to get those custom colors working, most of the time I notice the breaks becasuse I use Discord daily, and if it takes a few days to get fixed I'll notify him.
