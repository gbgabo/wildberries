## Installation

1. Download the .zip file from this page
2. Extract it
3. Place it inside /path/to/obsidian/vault/folder/.obsidian/themes
4. Activate it by going to the Obsidian Settings menu and on Options -> Appearance -> Themes if you click on the arrows it should appear, select it and there you go
5. Special thanks to an unkown source for the base theme, I can't remember where I found it

## Troubleshoot

1. Make sure you placed it on the .obsidian folder that's INSIDE your vault, not on the one that's outside
2. Make sure that the folder that contains the manifest.json and theme.css files has the EXACT (CASE SENSITIVE!!!) name as the one indicated on the manifest.json file otherwise Obsidian will not detect it
