## Installation

1. Download the .css file from this page
2. Extract it
3. Place it inside /path/to/BetterDiscord/themes
4. Activate it by going to the Discord Settings menu and on BetterDiscord -> Themes, you should see the theme click the enable button

## Troubleshoot

1. If it doesn't get detected make sure that the name is wildberries(or any other name).theme.css, .THEME.CSS otherwise it won't be detected by BetterDiscord

## Warning

1. As of 25/3/2025 the theme.css is broken because Discord updated their UI, since I am not the one responsible for BetterDiscord css design I cannot do anything but inform you that this .css theme will not work
