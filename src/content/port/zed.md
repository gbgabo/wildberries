1. Download the wildberries.json on this page
2. Place it on ~/.config/zed/themes
3. To activate it go to Zed's menu which is the three bars on the top left, clock on the select theme and type wildberries and it will activate
4. Special thanks to an anonymous user on Reddit who had the Zed Dev version and used the Zed theme importer to port the theme from VSCode, it was further tweaked to account for color inconsistencies
